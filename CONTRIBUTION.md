# Contributing to the project:

First of all, we are happy to see you and are looking forward to your contributions to the GWGbot</br>
I am `Kittycat#5642` and I will (along with a few other) be looking at all your PRs :)

## Prerequisites:

The project has been written in Python 3 and enhanced-discord.py hence some prior knowledge is required</br>
You must also be familier with discord.ext command handler if you are looking forward to add new commands</br>

## Project structure:

The project root folder has the `src/main.py` which serves as the entry point for the Bot.</br>
All commands are included in the `src/commands` folder.</br>

## Conventions:

- All files must be appropiately commented to help future contributors
- The project can be tested by running `python main.py`
